It is pronounced `smurf`

# tl;dr:

**Note: Tested on fedora 23, other OSes might need manual tweaking of dependencies.**

## We need your help!

Simply send an email to the [Smurf Mailing List](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/smf-dev)

## RPC mechanism using flatbuffers & seastar - DONE

Our rpc mechanism uses a binary protocol (very fast) using
[flatbuffers](https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/) and
[seastar](http://www.seastar-project.org/)

See our documentation for more details(todo add link)

The executive summary from a user's perspective it feels like facebook's
proxygen HTTP Service. It allows for chainable incoming and outgoing filters &
a main RPC method. It gates the RPC with a memory monitor as to not exhaust
the memory on the machine. It will do load shedding at maximum memory minus
constant factor.

## WAL (Write Ahead Log) - DONE

There is a write ahead log writer that is pretty high performance. It uses the
O_DIRECT capabilities of the seastar filesystem API. It also provides hooks into
the IO Scheduler of seastar to prioritize requests, specially invalidations.


## In the works

* Chain-replication protocol  (WIP: 60%)
* Raft consensus protocol (WIP: 30%)
* Brissa (content dissemination: 10%)

Using these protocols Raft (for chain management) & chain-replication, I'm
hoping to build a very fast 'safe' log broker.

# debugging - set core_pattern

These are the core pattern directives

```
%c  core file size soft resource limit of crashing process (since Linux 2.6.24)
%d  dump modeâ€”same as value returned by prctl(2) PR_GET_DUMPABLE (since Linux 3.7)
%e  executable filename (without path prefix)
%E  pathname of executable, with slashes ('/') replaced by exclamation marks ('!') (since Linux 3.0).
%g  (numeric) real GID of dumped process
%h  hostname (same as nodename returned by uname(2))
%i  TID of thread that triggered core dump, as seen in the PID namespace in which the thread resides (since Linux 3.18)
%I  TID of thread that triggered core dump, as seen in the initial PID namespace (since Linux 3.18)
%p  PID of dumped process, as seen in the PID namespace in which the process resides
%P  PID of dumped process, as seen in the initial PID namespace (since Linux 3.12)
%s  number of signal causing dump
%t  time of dump, expressed as seconds since the Epoch, 1970-01-01 00:00:00 +0000 (UTC)
%u  (numeric) real UID of dumped process

```

```
 # This is what I set my core dump as. A bit verbose, but easy to read
 root$ echo 'core_dump.file_name(%e).signal(%s).size(%c).process_id(%p).uid(%u).gid(%g).time(%t).initial_pid(%P).thread_id(%I)' > /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern
```

# Getting started on Fedora 25


```bash
 root$ cd $ROOT/meta
 root$ source source_ansible_bash
 root$ ansible-playbook playbooks/devbox_all.yml
