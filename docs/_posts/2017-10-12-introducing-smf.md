## [**smf** RPC]({{site.baseurl}}rpc)


**smf** is a new RPC system and code generation like gRPC, Cap n Proto,
Apache Thrift, etc, but designed for **microsecond tail latency**.

Current benchmarks in microseconds

| 60 byte payload  | latency   |
| ---------------- | --------- |
| p50              | 7us       |
| p90              | 8us       |
| p99              | 8us       |
| p9999            | 15us      |
| p100             | 26us      |


Highlights:
---

* Code generation compiler for RPC
* Load testing framework for RPC subsystem 
* Kernel-bypass RPC via DPDK
* 0-copy Serialization framework based on Google's Flatbuffers project
* Arbitrary filter chaining on incoming and outgoing channels (like twitter's Finagle)
* Small 16byte overhead
* Binary with pluggable compressors
