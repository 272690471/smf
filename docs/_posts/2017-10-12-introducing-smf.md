## [**smf** RPC]({{site.baseurl}}rpc)


**smf** is a new RPC system and code generation like gRPC, Cap n Proto,
Apache Thrift, etc, but designed for **microsecond tail latency**.

Current benchmarks in microseconds

| 60 byte payload  | latency   |
| ---------------- | --------- |
| p50              | 7us       |
| p90              | 8us       |
| p99              | 8us       |
| p9999            | 15us      |
| p100             | 26us      |


Highlights:
---

* Code generation compiler for RPC
* Load testing framework for RPC subsystem 
* Kernel-bypass RPC via DPDK
* 0-copy Serialization framework based on Google's Flatbuffers project
* Arbitrary filter chaining on incoming and outgoing channels (like twitter's Finagle)
* Small 16byte overhead
* Binary with pluggable compressors

## We need your help!

We have a lot of issues marked as [good first issue](https://github.com/senior7515/smf/labels/good%20first%20issue)

Look at the [contributing](https://github.com/senior7515/smf/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) 
guideline for more details. 

Take a look at the issue list or send an email to the
[smf-dev mailing List](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/smf-dev)
to get started. 

## Getting started


```bash


cd $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/misc
./provision_vagrant.sh


```

This will give you a working VirtualBox machine to edit & run code.

Development happens on Fedora25 OS & gcc6 environment, 
but we have Ubuntu support as long as you have gcc6.

Simply run:

```bash

ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
cd $ROOT/meta
source source_ansible_bash
ansible-playbook playbooks/devbox_all.yml

```
